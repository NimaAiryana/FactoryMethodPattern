Factory method is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Applicability
1-  Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.

2-  Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.

3-  Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.
